# bazel-rust-guided-experiment

A blog-post style collection of project states as we move from a vendored cargo project to bazel.
The rendered version is available at <https://prestontw.github.io/bazel-rust-guided-experiment/>.

## TODO

When <https://github.com/rust-lang/mdBook/pull/1908> is merged in,
we can ignore a lot of the vendored dependencies for `mdbook`.
This should hopefully improve the performance of local iteration a lot.
